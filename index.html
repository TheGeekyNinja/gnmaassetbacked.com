            <h3>Debtor-in-Possession Financing</h3>
            <p>
              Debtor-in-possession financing or DIP financing is a special form
              of financing provided for companies in financial distress,
              typically during restructuring under corporate bankruptcy law.
              Usually, this debt is considered senior to all other debt, equity,
              and any other securities issued by a company-violating any
              absolute priority rule by placing the new financing ahead of a
              company's existing debts for payment.
